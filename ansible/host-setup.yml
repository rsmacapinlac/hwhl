# Host Initial Setup Playbook
# ============================================
# This playbook performs initial setup on new hosts/containers:
#   - Creates ansible user with SSH keys
#   - Configures sudo access
#   - Sets up basic system configuration
#
# This should be run once for each new host before running site.yml.
# It requires root access to the host.
#
# Usage:
#   ansible-playbook host-setup.yml
#   ansible-playbook host-setup.yml --limit <host-group>
