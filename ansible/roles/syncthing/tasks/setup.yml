      Please review and update the following settings:
      - PUID/PGID: User and group IDs for container permissions
      - TZ: Timezone for the service

      Sync folder volumes should be configured in your inventory file using the 'syncthing_volumes' variable.
      Example:
        syncthing_volumes:
          - { name: "Music", host_folder: "/mnt/storage/Music", container: "/Music" }
          - { name: "Documents", host_folder: "/mnt/storage/Documents", container: "/Documents" }

      After configuration, deploy with: ansible-playbook site.yml --limit syncthing
  when: not syncthing_env_file.stat.exists
  delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
  become: false
